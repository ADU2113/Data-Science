## Data Science Roadmap – from Basics to Advanced ✨  
 

Hey there! 👋  
I'm **Aditi**, and I’m currently brushing up on my Data Science knowledge.  
As part of this journey, I’ve decided to create this roadmap to help:

- 🚀 **Beginners** who are just starting out, and  
- 🔁 **Professionals** who want to quickly revise key concepts.

This repository is a growing collection of my personal **notes, Jupyter notebooks, code snippets, and project explorations**—everything from **Python fundamentals** to **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and more!

### 🧩 What You'll Find Here:
- 📘 Well-organized folders by topic
- 🧪 Practice notebooks with hands-on code
- 📌 Concise notes and examples
- 💡 Helpful resources I discover along the way

### 🛣️ My Learning Path:
1. Python 🐍
2. SQL 🗃️
3. Statistics & Math 📊
4. Machine Learning 🤖
5. Deep Learning 🧬
6. Projects & Case Studies 📂
7. Bonus: Tools & Resources 🛠️
